# The_Math_of_Intelligence
This is the Syllabus for Siraj Raval's new course "The Math of Intelligence"

Each week has a short video (released on Friday) and an associated longer video (released on Wednesday). So each weeks short video is in bold and the longer video is underneath.

This repository is for the code relative to each week's **short video**
